## Benchmark Highlights
GISA is a benchmark for General Information-Seeking Assistants with 373 human-crafted queries that reflect real-world information needs. It includes both stable and live subsets, four structured answer formats (item, set, list, table), and complete human search trajectories for every query.
- **Diverse answer formats with deterministic evaluation.**  
  GISA uses four structured answer types (item, set, list, table) with strict matching metrics for reproducible evaluation, avoiding subjective LLM judging while preserving task diversity.
- **Unified deep + wide search capabilities.**  
  Tasks require both vertical reasoning and horizontal information aggregation across sources, evaluating long-horizon exploration and summarization in one benchmark.
- **Dynamic, anti-static evaluation.**  
  Queries are split into stable and live subsets; the live subset is periodically updated to reduce memorization and keep the benchmark challenging over time.
- **Process-level supervision via human trajectories.**  
  Full human search trajectories are provided for every query, serving as gold references for process reward modeling and imitation learning while validating task solvability.
